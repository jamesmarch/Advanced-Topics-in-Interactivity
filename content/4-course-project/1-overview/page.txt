Title: Overview

----

Text: *The Plan*
For this term, each of you will work individually to design and develop an interactive product of your choice. You will demonstrate through research and testing that the product makes a marked improvement in its usability, accessibility and intuitiveness. <br />
Have you ever asked yourself: “why is something made like this and not like this? Why is this more difficult than it should be? How could something so obvious be overlooked? Why can’t a well-educated adult understand this?” <br />
This course provides you with the time and resources to “scratch that itch”—to improve upon an interaction between a human and an electronic in a positive and supportive environment.<br />
*The Workback Schedule*
Research, planning, visualizing and prototyping will all be part of the process. This process will be broken down into phases:<br />
