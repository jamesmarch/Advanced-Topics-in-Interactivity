Title: High Fidelity Prototypes

----

Text: Develop a High Fidelity prototype of your product. This includes developing a clear visual language that works across the product to address the stated goals, problem space and user needs (see your Design Brief). <br />
This prototype should be  visually refined to consider typography, hierarchy, colour, icons and user interface elements. The graphics should be pixel-perfect, scalable and usable for the targeted device(s). <br />
Consider the changing states of your product and how the visuals support the user through the various stages of interaction. Develop the screens with ideal content in order to demonstrate a user scenario. <br />
