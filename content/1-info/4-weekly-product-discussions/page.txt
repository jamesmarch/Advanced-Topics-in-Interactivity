Title: Weekly Product Discussions

----

Text: Every other week, you will be expected to prepare a four minute presentation of the work you've accomplished since last class. There will also be four minutes allotted to questions and critiques by your peers after each presentation. This practice will ensure an active,  collaborative, discussion-based peer-reviewed process throughout the course of the project development. Presentations will be informal and casual in nature.
